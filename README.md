## Usage
```bash
$ cargo run -- and test.txt 
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.01s
     Running `/home/KunalSharma/Documents/programming/rust/minigrep/target/debug/minigrep and test.txt`
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
$
$ # for case insensitive seaching
$ IGNORE_CASE=1 cargo run -- and test.txt 
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.01s
     Running `/home/KunalSharma/Documents/programming/rust/minigrep/target/debug/minigrep and test.txt`
IGNORE_CASE is set by environment variable
And sorry I could not travel both
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
And having perhaps the better claim,
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
And both that morning equally lay
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
And that has made all the difference.
